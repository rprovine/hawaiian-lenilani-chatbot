   ```

2. Verify API key is correct:
   - No extra spaces
   - Starts with `pat-`
   - Has proper scopes

3. Test the connection:
   ```python
   # In Render Shell
   python -c "
   import os
   key = os.getenv('HUBSPOT_API_KEY')
   print(f'Key configured: {\"Yes\" if key else \"No\"}')
   print(f'Key format valid: {\"Yes\" if key and key.startswith(\"pat-\") else \"No\"}')
   "
   ```

### Rate Limits
